There is simply too many of them. It does so many things, it is so great that actually you don’t know how to master it, and that is sad.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Unfortunately, like Photoshop, we could not just cut somethings out, (actually, we were developing more modules every week) so we needed to find a unique and easy way to navigate and locate stuff.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    And there’s nothing better than start typing: “Prod...” and instantly seeing 72 menu items turning into 3, and you can choose one with your keyboard arrows.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    By creating a search navigation shortcut, we actually eliminated the need to navigate through the menu, you no longer needed to remember where something is located, you could just start typing its name, and it’s there.<br>\n                    And we could even tune the results by adding “tags” to menu items so you could find related functionalities as well.\n                </p>\n\n                <h2 class=\"subtitle\">Ask me!</h2>\n                <p>\n                    Sometimes finding the right place to go is not everything, you may need some guidance.

But it should.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Our clients, and their employees, use the same system every day, all day long, and that may be not only be boring, but also lead to errors, stress, and a perception that the system is the culprit when something bad happens.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    So, we not only guide our UX through the content and functionalities, but through the people that use it every day. It should feel fresh, every day. It should feel cheerful, every day. Be a partner, not just a system.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Achieving this was hard, but using animations in the right place, happy colors, beautiful icons, smooth transitions, and a well-balanced structure have given this old panel a constant feeling of youthfulness. That is why our visual identity is what it is, we reflect our own team mindset and mood to inspire our clients to feel the same.\n                </p>\n\n                <img class=\"elephant\" src=\"@/assets/work/admin/elephant.svg\" alt=\"A big blue elephant, sitting and looking a little smartphone shaped door\">\n\n                <h2 class=\"subtitle\">\n                    Responsive.<br>\n                    Because 2019.\n                </h2>\n\n                <p>\n                    It may sound irrelevant since we already take it for granted, but when it comes down to e-commerce platforms responsiveness still somewhat new.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    So we adapted this clumsy panel to work on small screens, and that demanded a lot of creativity because we did not touch the default HTML markup that came with Magento.<br>\n                    No. Everything was made with vanilla CSS & JavaScript. We did it this way so we could keep updating our core without worrying about fixing the layout.\n                </p>\n\n                <div class=\"video\">\n                    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zvfm8c9A3rI?controls=1&rel=0&showinfo=0&modestbranding=1&color=purple\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                </div>\n\n                <h2 class=\"subtitle\">\n                    Less peel, more stuffing\n                </h2>\n                <p>\n                    Another common problem with large admin panels is that their tables, blocks, boxes, containers, buttons, etc. get in the way of its content.

For example show this header on every page at this position, and at the checkout page at that position.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    All of that without touching a single XML file, or a PHTML template or anything, just some boxes and buttons on your panel.\n                </p>\n\n            </div>\n\n            <nav class=\"work-nav\">\n                <h3>// More...</h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li class=\"prev\">\n                        <router-link to=\"/work/confianca\" title=\"Confiança\">\n                            <svg class=\"nav-ico -prev\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path d=\"M5,1h10v10 M5.5,10.5l0.8-0.8\"/></svg>\n                            Confiança...\n                        </router-link>\n                    </li>\n                    <li class=\"next\">\n                        <router-link to=\"/work/desbravando\" title=\"Desbravando\">\n                            ...Desbravando\n                            <svg class=\"nav-ico -next\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path d=\"M5,1h10v10 M5.5,10.5l0.8-0.8\"/></svg>\n                        </router-link>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </nav>\n\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    // styles\n    import '@/styles/work.scss'\n    import '@/styles/work/admin.scss'\n    // ScrollMagic\n    import * as ScrollMagic from \"scrollmagic\";\n\n    export default {\n        name: 'admin',\n        props: {\n            viewport: Object,\n        },\n        data() {\n            return {\n                intro: new TimelineMax(),\n                scroller: new ScrollMagic.Controller(),\n            }\n        },\n        methods: {},\n        mounted() {\n\n            /**\n             * @desc\n             * Intro scene\n             */\n            this.intro\n                .clear(true)\n                .addLabel('enter', 1)\n                .from('.title', 2, {\n                    autoAlpha: 0,\n                    rotationX: 20,\n                    transformOrigin: '50% 50% -100px',\n                    ease: Power3.easeOut,\n                }, 'enter')\n                .from('.std', 2, {\n                    autoAlpha: 0,\n                    x: -32,\n                    ease: Power3.easeOut,\n                }, 'enter+=1.5');\n\n            /**\n             * @desc\n             * bg color scene\n             */\n            let sceneBg = new ScrollMagic.Scene({\n                triggerElement: '.project-start',\n                duration: document.body.offsetHeight\n            })\n                .addTo(this.scroller)\n                .reverse(true);\n\n            sceneBg\n                .on('enter', (e) => {\n                    document.body.classList.add('-admin-bg');\n                })\n                .on('leave', (e) => {\n                    if(e.scrollDirection === 'REVERSE'){\n                        document.body.classList.remove('-admin-bg');\n                    }\n                });\n\n            /**\n             * @desc\n             * before-after scene\n             */\n            let tlComparison = new TimelineMax();\n\n            tlComparison.to('.old-new .new', 4, {\n                width: '100%',\n                ease: Power0.easeNone\n            });\n\n            let sceneComparison = new ScrollMagic.Scene({\n                triggerElement: '.old-new',\n                duration: this.viewport.h/2\n            })\n                .setTween(tlComparison)\n                .addTo(this.scroller)\n                .reverse(true);\n\n            /**\n             * @desc\n             * more screens scene\n             */\n            let tlMoreScreens = new TimelineMax();\n\n            tlMoreScreens\n                .staggerFrom('.more-screens .m, .more-screens .d', 4, {\n                    xPercent: 100,\n                    autoAlpha: 0,\n                    ease: Power2.easeOut,\n                    stagger: .5\n                });\n\n            let sceneMoreScreens = new ScrollMagic.Scene({\n                triggerElement: '.more-screens',\n                offset: -this.viewport.h/2,\n                duration: this.viewport.h\n            })\n                .setTween(tlMoreScreens)\n                .addTo(this.scroller)\n                .reverse(true);\n\n        },\n        beforeDestroy() {\n\n            this.scroller.destroy();\n\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Admin.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
